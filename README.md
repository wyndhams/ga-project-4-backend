# General Assembly Project Four
## Festi: a Python Django API and React App
### Please find the full deployment of the app [here](https://festi-front-end.netlify.app/)

This was my final project built on the Immersive Software Engineering course with General Assembly. Festi is a full-stack application designed to help users search for new music festivals for the summer months. This is the first project I have built using Django as the backend framework for api routing and used PostGreSQL to create the database of festivals.
